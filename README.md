## Data Analysis Process

1. **Data Onboarding**: 
   - Imported data from **Kaggle** (furniture sales dataset).
   - Cleaned the data using **Power Query** in Excel to handle missing values, standardize formats, and transform the data into a usable format for analysis.
   - Imported the cleaned data into **Power BI** for in-depth analysis.

2. **Insights Generation**: 
   - Analyzed sales trends, customer demographics, and product performance.
   - Generated actionable recommendations for optimizing sales, such as focusing on high-performing products and adjusting marketing strategies for underperforming items.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Created various visualizations (KPIs, bar charts, scatter plots, etc.) to effectively communicate the findings and recommendations.
   - Used Power BIâ€™s interactive features like slicers and filters to allow users to explore data in different ways.
